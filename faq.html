                                They're <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/Unturned/">Unturned</a> plugins. More specifically, they are written for the <a href="https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket.Unturned">RocketMod</a> plugin framework. I am considering expanding to other games in the future.

                                Like any other. Drag and drop into the /Plugins/ directory. You can find the download on the GitHub release page. Make sure
                                that you download the dll or zip and not the source code!

                                Yeah, they are. If I weren't an honest person, maybe they wouldn't be. If you don't trust the precompiled .dlls, just compile the source with Visual Studio yourself.

                                Yes. All of the source is written by myself. None of it is taken from other plugins unless mentioned otherwise in the plugin's description.
