description_short: Break wheels, damage your car more realistically with VehicleEssentials.
description: |
  VehicleEssentials makes car accidents in Unturned more realistic. With accident effects in addition to a belt system, configurable in your own way, you can break a wheel, have nausea in a car crash, get hurt in a car crash, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  This plugin requires the Belt UI workshop plugin for effects.
