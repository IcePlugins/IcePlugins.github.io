IcePlugins is a plugin repository created by ExtraConcentratedJuice. My mission is to deliver free, open source plugins for Unturned servers so that you don't have to pay $5 for 20 lines of code. 


All of the plugins listed on this website are my creations.

Website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), theme (I modified it!) is available [here](https://github.com/sharu725/cards).

If you would like to request a plugin or report a bug, you can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/G2EuW2H).
