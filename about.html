                <h3 class="icefont about-text">IcePlugins was created with a single mission: to produce FOSS Unturned plugins for everybody to use and learn from. All of the plugins on this website run on Unturned's popular plugin loader, RocketMod. All of our Unturned plugins are free and open source. Most are licensed under the most permissive license possible, <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL</a>. The majority of the plugins on this website are created by a cool man named <a href="https://github.com/extraconcentratedjuice">ExtraConcentratedJuice</a>. This website is also maintained by the same cool man. If you would like to contribute to development, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/iceplugins">GitHub</a>. If you would like to buy the cool man named ExtraConcentratedJuice something nice, donate to his Bitcoin wallet.</h3>
